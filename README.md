# Restaurant Aggregate Rating Prediction Model

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of restaurants based on various features available in the dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the aggregate rating (like Yelp or Google ratings) of restaurants using machine learning techniques. This README provides an overview of the dataset, the model development process, evaluation metrics, and instructions for replicating the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- **Restaurant Features**: Attributes such as location, cuisine type, price range, etc.
- **User Reviews**: Historical reviews and ratings given by users.
- **Miscellaneous Features**: Additional information like opening hours, popularity metrics, etc.

## Machine Learning Model

The model development process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature engineering (if applicable).

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choosing appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting).
   - Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like cross-validation.

3. **Training**:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Training the model on the training set.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
   - Visualizing predictions vs. actual ratings.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Saving the trained model for future predictions.
   - Building a simple inference script for making predictions on new data.

## Setup Instructions

To replicate and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Python and necessary libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib) are installed.
   - Use a virtual environment for package management (e.g., conda, virtualenv).

2. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Download the dataset or connect to the database where it resides.
   - Preprocess the data as described in the preprocessing section.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Run the training script (`train_model.py`) to train the model.
   - Adjust hyperparameters or try different algorithms based on performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model performance using the evaluation metrics mentioned.
   - Visualize the results to understand model predictions.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Optionally, deploy the model using a web service (e.g., Flask API) for real-time predictions.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an introduction to building machine learning models for predicting restaurant ratings based on various features. Feel free to expand upon the model's capabilities, improve performance, or explore additional datasets for further analysis.
